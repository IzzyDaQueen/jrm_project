# *This Is My First Online Project - Maze2House(Gingerbread Edition)*

I am making a game targeting old people but youngsters and others can also play. 

## How to Play?

Your avatar is a ginger bread man who has to clear mazes to reach his home. 

There are levels and each level gets harder.

Your objective is to clear each maze in a limited time collecting the stated number of milk to open the lock of the house after you clear the maze. There are obstacles on the way such as milkmen who ask you questions. 

## Details

- You have to collect milk and chocolate.
- You restart if you do not clear the maze in the stated time.
- The milk is guarded by milkmen.
- If you answer the questions that the milkmen ask you correctly, he allows you to take the milk, pass and then he dissapears. If you answer wrongly, you cannot get the milk bottle or pass.
